1. if someone has logged in but didnt logged out, and someone else tries to login with wrong credentials will still will be logged in
2. so the error that was causing responsiveness issue was <body></body> element 
3. if someone is already logged in, you will be end up in his account 
4. Huge headache : somehow i am able to do operations in atlas cloud server but local mongoDB is giving me cors issue. ****** 
   - nodejs install, everything looks working but somehow still issue
   - whatever for now let's go with the atlas

5. If you ever get confused in React-router-dom -> just checkout App.jsx
6. add leads still missing created by and assigned to 
7. trying to add lead from employee side showing success but data is not getting added on DB 
is should show this is unauthorized message
8: if the user is logged out while adding lead he will have to refill the details after logged in again
9: i have thought of like generating leads with AI.
10 : add delete leads, users functionality
