create database drawing on dbdiagram.io - just paste the code and it will work
npm installed : express, mongoose, nodemon, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
//mongosh to get the database link 

inorder to run backend : nodemon app.js || node app.js

challenges :
MondoDB local database not connecting -> 
Window + R => services.msc => find MondoDB server or MongoDB -> right click -> start


Step 3: CRUD = 4 QUESTIONS
ish route ko kon bula rha hai, kon sa model, ky doondhna hai, CRUD
//basically know the rishta - relationship
For every route, ask:
Who is calling?
What model?
Find by what?
Update/delete/create what?
That’s it.

!! now as i have done with all modals and routes, i am confused what to do next
!! so i just think it will be good to proceed with frontend 
after login - dashboard for admin, manager and sales_rep will be different

-----------------------------FRONTEND-------------------------------
starting with just login things
i realised that i should have first confirmed the tech stack i should use

i have created the frontend for login and signup - CORS err (backend mei npm cors install kro)
and app.js mei require cors and use(cors()) - done

----what should i do next?
Why NOT full dashboard now? (important)
Right now:
1. You don’t have leads flowing
2. No interactions
3. No pipeline data
4. No scoring
So dashboards would be:
❌ Hardcoded numbers
❌ Fake charts
❌ You’ll rewrite everything later

----do what
👉 DO NOT jump into “full dashboards” yet
👉 DO THIS NEXT (in this order):
1️⃣ Define role powers (capabilities) — on paper
2️⃣ Build ONE shared dashboard layout
3️⃣ Build ONE real feature: Lead List + Lead Detail
4️⃣ THEN enhance dashboards with metrics
Dashboards without real data = fake progress.

--------issue facing : react css style via react dispay block 
and display none pr not working

---------------“React me DOM ko haath mat lagao”----------

bug : dashboard mei view button pe initially 2 times click krne pe show hoga
