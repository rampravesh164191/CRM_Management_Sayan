create database drawing on dbdiagram.io - just paste the code and it will work
npm installed : express, mongoose, nodemon, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
//mongosh to get the database link 

inorder to run backend : nodemon app.js || node app.js

challenges :
MondoDB local database not connecting -> 
Window + R => services.msc => find MondoDB server or MongoDB -> right click -> start


Step 3: CRUD = 4 QUESTIONS
ish route ko kon bula rha hai, kon sa model, ky doondhna hai, CRUD
//basically know the rishta - relationship
For every route, ask:
Who is calling?
What model?
Find by what?
Update/delete/create what?
That’s it.

!! now as i have done with all modals and routes, i am confused what to do next
!! so i just think it will be good to proceed with frontend 
after login - dashboard for admin, manager and sales_rep will be different

-----------------------------FRONTEND-------------------------------
starting with just login things
i realised that i should have first confirmed the tech stack i should use

i have created the frontend for login and signup - CORS err (backend mei npm cors install kro)
and app.js mei require cors and use(cors()) - done

----what should i do next?
Why NOT full dashboard now? (important)
Right now:
1. You don’t have leads flowing
2. No interactions
3. No pipeline data
4. No scoring
So dashboards would be:
❌ Hardcoded numbers
❌ Fake charts
❌ You’ll rewrite everything later

----do what
👉 DO NOT jump into “full dashboards” yet
👉 DO THIS NEXT (in this order):
1️⃣ Define role powers (capabilities) — on paper
2️⃣ Build ONE shared dashboard layout
3️⃣ Build ONE real feature: Lead List + Lead Detail
4️⃣ THEN enhance dashboards with metrics
Dashboards without real data = fake progress.

-----------> for more check dashboard planning.txt file

--------issue facing : react css style via react dispay block 
and display none pr not working

---------------“React me DOM ko haath mat lagao”----------

//connect database to server 
issue : you're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted.
-- this is classical error -: altal me jaake network access sets to from anywhere or current ip address

//frontend - faced huge issue while deployment
//i have named the file wrong itself instead of "vercel" i wrote "varcel"

vercel.json 
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
} 

// and put favicon.ico in public folder

varcel -> add project -> select repo and folder of frontend
npm run build 
dist 
npm install

----------------------after long time like 20days---------
after RPG clearance notification

here something about haveing LICENSE in project means anyone can leagally look at my project
no license means you can't even look at my code
so i made LICENSE file in the project
