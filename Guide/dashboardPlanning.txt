------------------After login signup----------
----what should i do next?
Why NOT full dashboard now? (important)
Right now:
1. You don’t have leads flowing
2. No interactions
3. No pipeline data
4. No scoring
So dashboards would be:
❌ Hardcoded numbers
❌ Fake charts
❌ You’ll rewrite everything later

----do what
👉 DO NOT jump into “full dashboards” yet
👉 DO THIS NEXT (in this order):
1️⃣ Define role powers (capabilities) — on paper
2️⃣ Build ONE shared dashboard layout
3️⃣ Build ONE real feature: Lead List + Lead Detail
4️⃣ THEN enhance dashboards with metrics

-------------------Dashboards without real data = fake progress.-------------------------

Step 1️⃣ Decide POWERS (very important)

Let’s lock this first.
Simple, realistic, scalable.

Admin (System Owner)

Powers : Create users, Assign roles, See everything, Basic system stats
❌ Admin does NOT work on leads daily

Manager (Team Lead)
Powers : View all leads, Assign leads to sales reps, See team performance, Edit lead stage, See pipeline

Sales Rep (Executor)
Powers : View only assigned leads, Update lead status, Add interactions (call, email, meeting), Add follow-up reminders
❌ Cannot create users
❌ Cannot delete leads

👉 This mental model should drive your UI

-------------------------------Step 2️⃣ Build ONE shared dashboard layout-----------------------
DashboardLayout
 ├── Sidebar (changes by role)
 ├── Topbar
 └── Main Content (routes)

Each role:
Sees different menu items
Same layout
This saves you tons of work.

-----------------------------Step 3️⃣ The FIRST REAL FEATURE YOU SHOULD BUILD--------------------
🔥 LEAD LIST + LEAD DETAIL

*************************This is the heart of CRM.*****************

Pages to build next (ONLY THESE)
/dashboard/leads
/dashboard/leads/:id

Why this first?
Because:
1. Every role touches leads
2. Dashboards need lead data
3. Interactions attach to leads
4. Reports depend on leads

What should the UI show RIGHT NOW?
For Sales Rep (first priority)
Leads List
Name	Status	Score	Next Follow-up

Actions: View, Update status, Add note

Lead Detail Page
Sections: Lead info, Interaction timeline, Follow-up date, Lead score (static for now)

Manager (same pages, extra powers) : Can see all leads, Can assign lead to sales rep, Can change deal stage

Admin : Can see leads (read-only), Focus later on users & reports

----------------------------------Step 4️⃣ Only AFTER that → Dashboards make sense---------------

Once you have: Leads, Status, Assignments, Interactions

Now dashboards become:
✅ Meaningful
✅ Automatic
✅ Easy

Dashboard metrics come from: Leads table, Interactions table, Users table
